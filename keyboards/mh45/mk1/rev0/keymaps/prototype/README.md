# The prototype keymap for MH45 MkI rev0

This is the first keyboard layout for the MH45 ever developed, and the motivation behind the whole project.
There were a couple of goals with this layout:

1. Have the MALTRON layout on a keyboard with as little switches as possible, but on a staggered layout.
2. Not deviating too much from a standard keyboard layout for location of modifier keys and function keys.
3. The 'FN' key is used to allow for easy access of the number keys and its shifted variants on the top row as with a standard 60% or 65% layout.
4. The 'FN' key is the only dedicated layer key to keep it simple.
5. Arrow keys must be part of the base layer.
6. Accepting the fact that the MALTRON layout is broken a bit for the advantage of having the arrow keys on the base layer.
7. The "broken" layout can be considered not too bad because it leaves the '-' key at the location of a normal QWERTY layout.
8. Only design the layout with macOS in mind.
