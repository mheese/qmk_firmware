# The default keymap for MH45 MkI rev0

This is a revised version of the prototype keymap.
There were a couple of goals with revising the layout:

1. Fix the actually wrong MALTRON layout.
   Even though it was a conscious decision before to do it like this - so that it could preserve arrow keys on the base layer - the problem is that the '-' is located on the right pinky which strains that finger too much.
2. Putting more keys onto the home row - in particular the ones used for coding.
3. Abandoning the thought of keeping the layout as close as possible to a standard keyboard layout.
4. Accepting that arrow keys must move to a dedicated 'NAV' layer.

It makes a lot more use of layers and tries to move a lot of frequently used keys to the home row with layer combinations.
The goal of the prototype actually was to avoid that.
However, praxis has shown that using layers is superior in the long run, and outweighs the benefit of not deviating too much from a standard layout.
It also provides alternate locations for 'Enter' and 'BackSpace' to reduce the strain on the pinky.
However, one of my key philosophies still holds true: do not use more than one switch for a thumb.
