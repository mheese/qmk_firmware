# MH45 Mk I (Rev0)

![MH45 Mk I (Rev0)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/f9c47230b040e785f7b0bdc2dfc172d1)

This is an idea for a ~45% staggered layout featuring the MALTRON letter layout.
It is an attempt to build a portable keyboard which still features the MALTRON layout *and* has a set of arrow keys.
With 13.25u it is as small as it can get for a staggered layout for MALTRON.
Going for 40% is only possible in an ortholinear layout as 40% staggered layouts (that fit planck cases) only keep 3 keys on the home row for the right hand.
However, this is impossible for the MALTRON layout.
